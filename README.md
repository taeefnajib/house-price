# House Price Prediction on Boston House Price Dataset Using PyTorch
Code is taken from: [here](https://github.com/Nanfengzhijia/Pytorch-boston-house-price/blob/master/homework-house-pytorch.py)
The original tutorial uses `load_boston()` method with is removed from `sklearn`, recently, because of a legal issue. 
So we used a `csv` file downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunjathari/bostonhousepricedata)
